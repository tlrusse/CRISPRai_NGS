# Build library file

Using the example in `data_out/examples` build the csv for the library file in that format
- 3 column format
- 1st column is unique identifier
- 2nd column is sequence (all caps)
- 3rd column is gene
- make sure to use the same format for nontargetting control guides (use same name)
